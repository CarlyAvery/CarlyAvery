ðŸ‘‹ Hi Iâ€™m Carly (She/Her),
  
After over a decade-long career, I am learning everything I can to switch over to a career in Business and Data Analytics while working full time, being a wife, caring for two kids under two, and housing a dog and cat. I wouldn't trade it for anything and all that is previously mentioned makes me work harder!

I love photography, traveling, performing (I was a Broadway performer in what seems like my previous life) and live music. 

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on EVERYTHING! I cannot wait to get my feet wet and jump into tech. 

Email me! Send me a message on Linkedin or Instagram! I would love to connect.

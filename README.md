ðŸ‘‹ Hi Iâ€™m Carly (She/Her), a passionate and analytic thinker transitioning into the world of business analysis. I thrive on solving problems, uncovering insights, and working with people to drive meaningful change. With a keen eye for detail and love for data-driven decision-making, I enjoy breaking down complex challenges and working directly with company stakeholders to find efficient solutions. 

**Technical skills:** 
- Proficient in SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Advanced Spreadsheets
- Strong foundation in business analytics

**Beyond the technical:**
- Highly collaborative and inquisitive
- Communication skills 
- Problem-solving and critical thinking
- Strong foundation in business analytics

**In my free time:**

I spend time with my husband and two young daughters, I love photography, traveling, performing (I was a Broadway performer in what seems like my previous life) and live music.

- 👋 Hi, I’m Carly! 
- 👀 I’m interested in photography, traveling, playing with my kids and goldendoodle pup, and live music. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can about Business and Data Analytics while working full time, being a wife, caring for two kids under two, and housing a dog and cat. I wouldn't trade it for anything and all previously mentioned makes me work harder!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on EVERYTHING! I cannot wait to get my feet wet and jump into tech. 
- 📫 Email me! Send me a message on Linkedin! I would love to connect. 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was a Broadway performer in my past life! My husband is a professional musician so I still get my musical fix while pursuing other avenues that I am passionate about.
